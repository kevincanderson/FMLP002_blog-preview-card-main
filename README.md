## My process

I approached this project as I did the QR Code Component project. Starting with the mobile layout, it came clear that the larger screens had different sizes for fonts, and margin/padding. Once I completed the mobile layout, i moved into the larger screen format. I used flexbox to center the card, as well as line up the author avatar and name.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to pay close attention to different designs. Getting the sizes right.

### Continued development

Continue to hone my skills and reduce overall code. Keep getting projects done!
